## Prime Number Decomposition API

The goal of this task is to implement a Prime Number Decomposition API using a
gRPC Server Streaming Service.

* The function takes a Request message that contains a number to decompose into
prime numberes.

* The server responds through a server streaming gRPC with the decomposed prime
factors of the number given.

* Implementation of the proto files is shared on both client and server (could be
a bit better)
